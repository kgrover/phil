# Existentialist Resources
**Simone de Beauvoir:** 

1. Ethics of Ambiguity
2. The Second Sex (A little less existentialist in nature, more feminist philosophy; but definitely brings in some very interesting ideas even contrasting Sartre’s work)

**Sartre:**

1. Existentialism is a Humanism 
2. Being and Nothingness (but I really wouldn’t try to read this…)
3. Nausea (though you’ll definitely get some of this in Camus)
4. Secondary Source (though a mix): Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre (Kaufmann)

**Camus**
1. The Myth of Sisyphus (Early philosophy)
2. The Rebel & The Stranger (bringing some more compromises later in his life)
3. Secondary: Albert Camus and the philosophy of the absurd (Sagi)

**Heidegger**

1. Being and Time (early philosophy)
2. What Is Called Thinking? (later; after “the turn in his work”)
3. Question Concerning Technology (very applicable/interesting!)
4. Secondary: Heidegger Explained (Harman)

**Husserl**

1. Cartesian Meditations
2. Secondary: Husserl’s Phenomenology (Dan Zahavi)
